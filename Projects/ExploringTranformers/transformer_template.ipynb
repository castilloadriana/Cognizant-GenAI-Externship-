      "In the future, education will become very complex. There are many factors that need to be considered. Most of them will likely be determined by the current student's needs, by the needs of the student community, by the student's ability to pay the bills of schooling and by the school principal or local school district. The student's need to meet these needs will be largely determined by the student's ability to pay the high school fees or by the student's willingness to pay them. It remains to be seen how effectively these factors will manifest themselves in the classroom. Will a student really understand the importance of a free-for-all school to be a good place to be? Will a student have this knowledge of what a good teacher is interested in? All of these factors can make a student feel comfortable in class. It is important to remember that students and faculty participate differently in the classroom. Those who feel that their learning is important may feel that if they are given the chance to learn in class they must come up with a good explanation of basic concepts and have a say in how others can better understand their own learning. They may find that their knowledge is so valuable that they would prefer doing the same thing for another student.

The photosynthetic sugars and sugars in plants are actually the energy that is needed to make the plants' food. Plants use photosynthesis to grow their own food, and the photosynthetic sugars and sugars that are produced by the photosynthesis act as energy sources for the plants.\n",
