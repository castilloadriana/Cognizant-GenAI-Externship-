# Cognizant GenAI Externship ‚Äì Projects & Reflections

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Cognizant Generative AI Externship**. This repo contains a collection of work completed during the externship, including hands-on Python exercises, fine-tuned generative models, capstone projects, and written reflections.

## üîç Overview

Throughout the externship, I:
- Completed structured Python programming exercises and standalone projects
- Built and fine-tuned **4 generative AI models** using **PyTorch**, **Hugging Face**, and **OpenAI‚Äôs API**
- Explored prompt engineering and model parameter tuning
- Reflected on model performance and limitations through written reports

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### `Assignments/`
Introductory Python exercises containing multiple small problems per file (`a1.py` to `a6.py`). Topics include:
- Lists, dictionaries, loops, and conditionals
- Function writing and basic algorithmic problem-solving

### `Projects/`
Longer, standalone Python programs designed to reinforce problem-solving. Examples:
- `calculator.py`: Basic command-line calculator
- `groceryTracker.py`: Simple grocery list tracker
- `passwordChecker.py`: Password validation tool

### `Capstone/`
Higher-level projects where I made more design decisions and built full Python programs with increased complexity and structure.

## ü§ñ GenAI Model Notebooks

The four main GenAI model projects are located inside their respective folders under `Projects/`. Each one explores a different model or technique:

### `gan_assignment.ipynb` (in root)
Used **BigGAN** to generate images from random latent vectors. Explored how varying input noise affects image output.

### `transformer_template.ipynb` (in `Projects/ExploringTransformers/`)
Used **GPT-2** to generate text from prompts. Experimented with prompt types, temperature, and max token settings.

### `bert.ipynb` & `fineTuningBERT.pdf` (in `Projects/BertFineTuning/`)
Fine-tuned a **BERT** model on a sentiment analysis task using public Twitter data. Evaluated performance and learned debugging techniques.

### `creativeApp.ipynb` (in `Projects/BertFineTuning/`)
Built a text generation script using **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 API**. Designed and tested different prompt strategies and parameter settings to evaluate generation quality.

## üìù Reflections

Each major modeling project is paired with a brief written reflection (PDF) covering:
- Model purpose and architecture
- Experiment process
- Observations and takeaways

Located in project folders (e.g., `fineTuningBERT.pdf`, `Cognizant_transformers.pdf`).
